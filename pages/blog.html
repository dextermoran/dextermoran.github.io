        <p>This week i spent some time setting up and deploying my site to a Digital Ocean droplet. The server runs ubuntu as an os and nginx to server my 
        currently static pageds. I had a ton of fun learning how to configure nginx and trying to understand how it works. At the moment i am waiting for my 
        domain name registrar to process the transfer of dextermoran.com from a squarespace page I used to maintain. </p>

        <p>At this point we’ve had some practice writing functions; approaching them from different angles
        and experimenting with different solutions. Up till this point we have largely graded the success 
        of our code by how easy it is to read or how elegant it feels. However, as we move on to challenges 
        more complicated than FizzBuzz, we need a way to evaluate the computational efficiency of our code.</p>
      
        <p>This is where big O notation comes in.  It is an expression that indicates the computation 
        time of an algorithm. Let’s say that we have a function that iterates through an array until if
        finds an item. The big big O notation for this function would be expressed as O(n). What this means
        is that the computation time will increase in direct relation to the size of the array the function 
        is given. A less efficient function might have a big O notation of O(n^2). This would mean that
        computation time would increase logarithmically as the array got bigger. </p>
        
        <p>This convention allows us to use any mathematical expression to convey how efficient our code is. 
        That means we can evaluate our FizzBuzz challenges in a far more technical manner!</p>

        <h3>Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript!</h3>

        <p>Looping, repeating a code block until a condition or counter has been met,
        is a fundamental part of both ruby and javascript. The simplest forms of these
        loops are the the for loop and the while loop. The while loop continues to repeat
        a block of code until a condition evaluates to false. A for loop on the other hand 
        iterates a predetermined number of times. The syntax between the two languages is
        a bit different, with javascript using curly braces as opposed to ruby’s end statement
        but the loops function fairly similarly otherwise. </p>

      	<p>However, that is where the similarities between the two languages end. Those two loops
      	mentioned above are the only two methods for looping in javascript. Ruby includes a substantial
      	number of methods that make it easy and faster to perform specific kinds of loops. The .each 
      	method can be used to iterate across an array or the .chunk method sperates values by a given 
      	parameter. The list could go on. Any of these functions could be accomplished with a standard
      	for or while loop but ruby provides encapsulated methods to make life a little easier for
      	a programmer. </p>

        <p> The easiest way to think about classes in ruby to view them as blueprints. 
        Say you wanted to build several similar houses. You could build each house individually, 
        figuring out each room as you went. This would be tedious and would require you to address 
        the same challenges for each house. A better way to go about building these homes would be 
        to draw up a blueprint first, so that you could simply follow the drawings and only have to
        go through the planning stages once. With some careful planning one could even draw up these
        plans in a way that allowed for some variation between the homes, they could be built to  suit 
        their individual plot of land or the colors of the walls could be changed. Lets look at an example: 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
class SuburbanHouse<br>

	def initialize(sq_footage, color)<br>
		@sq_footage = sq_footage<br>
		@color = color<br>
	end<br>
<br>
	def customization(boolean) <br>
		If true<br>
			@kitchen = “A+”<br>
			@Basement =  “super cool tv room”<br>
		Else<br>
			@Kitchen = “B-”<br>
			@Basement = “unfinished”<br>
		end <br>
	end <br>
<br>
	def real_estate_pitch<br>
		puts “ look at this beautiful #{@sq_footage} square foot home! Its painted #{@color} in literally every room and has a #{@kitchen} and #{@basement}!”<br>
	end <br>
End<br>
<br>
house1 = SuburbanHouse.new(2000, “purple”<br>
house1.customization(true)<br>
House1.real_estate_pitch<br>
<br>
=> look at this beautiful 200 square foot home! Its painted purple in literally every room and has a A+ kitchen and super cool tv room! <br>
</p>
<p>
This is a class definition for a suburban home It lets one define a ruby object 
as a home and assign it several properties of its own very easily. As you can see, 
it uses instance variable so that the data stored is available to every method of the class.
Every SuburbanHouse object created will have access to those methods, regardless of what parameters 
they are constructed with.

        <h3>The Cycle method!</h3>

      <div class="postContent">
        <p>The cycle method is an encapsulated looping method. It is similar to a for loop, or 
        a while loop paired with a counter, in how it can be used to execute a code block a specific 
        number of times. Another comparison that may be more accurate is one to the .each method, which 
        encapsulates the use of these loops for a slightly different purpose. </p>
	      
	      <p>One would use the .cycle method to cycle through an array a predetermined number of times. It works like this: </p>

        <p>a = ["a", "b", "c"]</p>
        <p>a.cycle(2) { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c.</p>
        
        <p>One calls .cycle on the array to iterate across and passes the desired number of iterations as an argument.
        If no argument is passed the method will loop indefinitely or until a break statement is reached.  </p>

        <p>At the core of it, arrays and hashes are very similar. Both are structures for storing a collection of items, 
        regardless of what type of variable they are. The key difference is that arrays store items through an indexing 
        system, In order to retrieve an item one uses the number bound to it’s position in the array to access it. Hashes,
        on the other hand, store items with a keyword system. This means that to retrieve an item one only needs to know the 
        keyword that the item was stored with. </p>
        
        <p>This potentially easier means of access in a hash can frequently be a positive, one doesn’t need to remember 
        specific numbers to find an item and could potentially use the keyword as an additional means clarifying the 
        information stored in the hash. This approach is certainly more human friendly seeing as it allows us to interact 
        with data structures in our natural language.  </p>

          Classes and Ids are a method of applying styling to specific elements of of an html document. While they they function in very nearly the same way there is one big difference, IDs are unique. It is bad practice to use an ID more than once in a file, in fact, your code won’t pass validation if an id is reused. For any purpose where styling needs to be applied to multiple elements one should use a class. One way to remember this really key difference is to think of classes as barcodes and id’s as serial numbers. Every Ipod in an apple store has a bar code, but serial numbers are unique to each specific ipod.
        <p> 
          So, in short, if you want to style more than one element at a time you should use a class, and if you want to style one single element use an Id!        </p>

          Hi Internet! There’s this cool thing called git that is a method of version control that lets you keep track of different versions of your work. No more Project_finial_revision_2_final.jpg anymore! Git creates an archive file of your work at it’s various stages. This means that if you ever want to revert to a previous version of your file you can pull up a log of your commits, review the messages you left as you changed things, and revert to any of your save points by using the number associated with it. Additionally, git allows you to create branches of your projects to work on. This is super cool because it lets you work on new features while keeping the master branch of your project stable and unchanged until your new feature is ready to be merged in. 
        </p>
        <p>      
          The real icing on the cake though is that git can be paired with a web service called GitHub that keeps your repository in the cloud. This lets you not only keep your work backed up, but lets you share your code with others and work collaboratively on a project. This is super important to remember because all the best things get build with others.
