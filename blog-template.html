How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  It was fun to figure it out with Dan! We screenshared and worked in photoshop together
  I feel that this sort of conceptual process works alot better when you have the input
  of another person. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  
  I did. I am a very visual person and starting out by thinking about the 
  layout of the page helps me plan how i would like to build it. However, i feel that given
  the choice i would probably prefer to sketch as it would allow me to prototype 
  and iterate more rapidly.
  
  
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

  We both really liked the idea of keeping the wireframe simple. It doesn't 
  feel like the approriate medium for figuring out the small details of the website.
  
  
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  We used div, paragraph, heading, footer, and list tags! This was my first time using the footer tag.
